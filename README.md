```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const delivr = require('delivr');
```

Run the build.

```js
delivr.prepare().then((build) => {
    // Put stuff in here:
    console.log('Temp dir:', build.path);

    // ... some time later ...

    // Move the temp dir to its permanent home, set up symlinks,
    // and upload the files on disk to S3.
    return build.finalize();
});
```

## API

Please see Amazon's [API documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html) for details on bucket names and authenticating with AWS.

### delivr.prepare(option)

Returns a promise for an object with these fields:

 - `path` is a newly created temporary directory for you to write the build to.
 - `finalize()` moves `path` to its final location, [links](https://github.com/sholladay/build-dir#builddirlinkoption) it, and uploads it to S3.

Type: `object`

Settings and known [build data](https://github.com/sholladay/build-data).

##### cwd

Type: `string`<br>
